## Development Environment Setup

The recommended way to develop for the Aegis Platform is using Docker. This ensures a consistent and reproducible environment that closely matches production.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js with `pnpm` (for frontend type-checking, linting, etc., if desired)

### First-Time Setup
1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Navigate to the platform directory:**
    ```bash
    cd aegis-platform
    ```
3.  **Create your environment file:**
    - Copy the example environment file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Open the new `.env` file and add any necessary secrets, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The default values are already configured for the Docker setup.
4.  **Build and start the services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
    ```
    - This command will build the Docker images for the frontend and backend, and start all services (database, cache, backend, frontend) in the background.

The platform is now running!
-   **Frontend:** Access it at `http://localhost:58533` (or the `FRONTEND_PORT_HOST` you set in `.env`).
-   **Backend API:** Available at `http://localhost:30641` (or the `BACKEND_PORT_HOST` you set in `.env`).
-   **API Docs:** View the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:30641/docs`.

### Daily Development Commands

-   **Start all services:**
    ```bash
    cd aegis-platform
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```
-   **View logs for all services:**
    ```bash
    cd aegis-platform
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f
    ```
-   **View logs for a specific service (e.g., backend):**
    ```bash
    cd aegis-platform
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f backend
    ```
-   **Stop all services:**
    ```bash
    cd aegis-platform
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
    ```
-   **Build frontend with proper environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cd aegis-platform
    ./build-frontend.sh
    ```

### Running Tests

Testing is crucial. Tests should be run inside the Docker containers to ensure they execute in the correct environment.

-   **Run backend regression tests:**
    ```bash
    cd aegis-platform
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec backend pytest tests/ -v
    ```
-   **Run frontend tests (unit, integration, E2E):**
    ```bash
    cd aegis-platform
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec frontend npm test
    ```
-   **Run frontend Playwright E2E tests specifically:**
    ```bash
    cd aegis-platform
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec frontend npx playwright test
    ```

## Project State Management

1. **Interval Summarization**
   - Every 5 conversation turns, or after any major decision/change, generate a concise summary of the current project state.
   - The summary should include:
     - Key decisions made
     - Current objectives or tasks
     - Any unresolved questions or TODOs

2. **State Injection**
   - At the start of each new session, request or inject the latest summary of the project state.
   - Use this summary to maintain continuity and avoid repeating previous work.

3. **Summary Update Protocol**
   - When prompted, or at the defined interval, update the summary and provide it in a clearly marked section (e.g., `## Project Summary`).
   - Save or export the summary for future sessions.

4. **Reminder**
   - If a session exceeds 5 turns without a summary update, remind the user to generate a new summary.

## Configuration Management

-   **Single Source of Truth:** The `aegis-platform/.env` file is the single source of truth for all environment configuration. It is created by copying `.env.example`.
-   **DO NOT commit your `.env` file.** It is ignored by Git via `aegis-platform/.gitignore`.
-   **How it works:** The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to load the `.env` file and pass the variables to the correct services. This includes port mappings, database credentials, and API keys.

## Common Issues

-   **Port Conflict:** If a service fails to start due to a port conflict (e.g., "port is already allocated"), stop the conflicting service on your machine or change the host port mapping (e.g., `FRONTEND_PORT_HOST`) in your `aegis-platform/.env` file and restart the Docker containers.
-   **"failed to solve: process..." error during `docker-compose build`:** This can happen if there's a network issue or a problem in a `Dockerfile` step. Check the build logs carefully. Running `docker-compose build --no-cache` can sometimes resolve caching issues.
-   **Backend can't connect to Database:** Ensure the `db` container is healthy (`docker-compose ps`). Check that the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file and the `docker-compose.yml` are configured correctly for the container network (i.e., the hostname should be `db`, not `localhost`).
-   **Frontend Container Health Issues:** Use the `./build-frontend.sh` script to ensure proper VITE environment variable handling during builds.

## Architecture & Key Components

### Backend Architecture
- **FastAPI**: Modern async Python web framework with automatic OpenAPI docs
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM with comprehensive models for cybersecurity risk management
- **Multi-LLM Service**: Modular AI provider system supporting 14+ LLM providers with automatic failover
- **Database**: SQLite (development) → MySQL (production) with Alembic migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control (Admin, Analyst, ReadOnly)

### Frontend Architecture  
- **React 18**: Modern functional components with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui**: Professional UI component library
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for SPA
- **Axios**: HTTP client with mock API fallback system
- **React Query**: Server state management and caching

### Core Domain Models
The application manages cybersecurity risk through these key entities:
- **Assets**: Organizational assets with risk categorization
- **Risks**: Risk register with scoring and prioritization
- **Frameworks**: Security frameworks (NIST, ISO27001, etc.)
- **Assessments**: Security assessments and control evaluations
- **Evidence**: Supporting documentation and proof
- **Tasks**: Risk remediation and compliance tasks
- **Reports**: Automated risk reporting and dashboards

### AI/LLM Integration
- **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, LiteLLM, OpenRouter, Together AI, DeepSeek, Cohere, Mistral, Hugging Face, Ollama, LM Studio, Text Generation WebUI
- **AI-Powered Features**: Evidence analysis, risk statement generation, control narrative generation, remediation suggestions, executive summaries
- **Failover System**: Automatic provider switching with performance monitoring
- **Cost Tracking**: Provider usage and cost optimization

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Key configuration is managed through environment variables in `backend/config.py`:

**Core Application:**
- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite file path for development, MySQL connection string for production
- `SECRET_KEY` / `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Security keys for authentication
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: Allowed frontend origins

**Database Migration Path:**
- Development: `sqlite:///./aegis_development.db`
- Production: `mysql://user:password@host:port/database`

**AI Providers:**
- `DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER`: Primary LLM provider (defaults to "openai")
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.: Provider API keys
- `ENABLE_*_PROVIDER`: Feature flags for each provider

**External Integrations:**
- `OPENVAS_HOST`, `OPENCTI_URL`: Vulnerability scanners and threat intelligence
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Microsoft Entra ID authentication

### API Configuration
- Frontend API client supports both real backend and comprehensive mock API system
- Mock API automatically activated when `VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true` or backend unavailable
- Base URL: Random port assignment for development, fixed ports for production

## Development Notes

### Virtual Environment Management
- **Always Required**: All Python operations must use virtual environment
- **Setup**: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
- **Verification**: `which python` should point to venv directory

### Database Management
- **Development**: SQLite database file (`aegis_development.db`)
- **Production**: MySQL with connection pooling and transactions
- **Migration Path**: Alembic handles schema changes between SQLite and MySQL
- **Commands**: 
  - `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`
  - `alembic upgrade head`

### Port Management
- **Development**: Always use random ports (10000-65535) via `$(shuf -i 10000-65535 -n 1)`
- **Frontend**: Update VITE_API_URL to match backend port
- **Backend**: Update CORS_ORIGINS to match frontend port

### AI Provider Development
- New providers should extend `backend/ai_providers/base.py`
- Provider registration happens in `backend/multi_llm_service.py`
- Each provider supports health checks, cost tracking, and performance monitoring

### Frontend Development
- Uses shadcn/ui component library - avoid creating custom components when shadcn alternatives exist
- API calls should use the `@/lib/api.ts` client which handles mock/real API switching
- Type definitions in `@/types/` should be kept in sync with backend schemas

### Testing Strategy
- **Regression Tests**: Must run after every feature completion
- **Backend**: `python -m pytest tests/ -v` in virtual environment
- **Frontend Unit**: `npm test` for component and integration tests
- **E2E Testing**: `npx playwright test` for full user workflow verification
- **Button Regression**: `npx playwright test button-functionality.spec.ts` for UI interaction verification
- **Integration**: End-to-end testing with real AI providers (when API keys available)

### Playwright Testing Guidelines
- Run after every UI feature implementation
- Verify button functionality doesn't regress
- Test complete user workflows (login → navigation → actions)
- Capture screenshots for visual verification
- Automated testing prevents manual testing issues from recurring

## Common Issues

### Backend Issues
- **Virtual Environment**: Ensure `source venv/bin/activate` before any Python commands
- **Database Connection**: SQLite file permissions for development, MySQL connectivity for production
- **AI Provider Failures**: Check API keys and provider health endpoints
- **Port Conflicts**: Always use random port assignment

### Frontend Issues  
- **API Connection**: Frontend automatically falls back to mock API if backend unavailable
- **Build Errors**: Ensure all environment variables are set correctly using `./build-frontend.sh`
- **Port Conflicts**: Use random port assignment for development servers
- **Type Errors**: Keep TypeScript types in sync with backend Pydantic schemas
- **Container Health**: Use proper healthcheck endpoints and ensure wget is available

## Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository
- All AI provider integrations support secure credential management
- JWT tokens are httpOnly cookies for security
- File uploads are validated and sanitized
- Database queries use SQLAlchemy ORM to prevent injection attacks
- Virtual environment isolation prevents system-wide package conflicts

## Memories

### Workflow Management
- remember to fix the assessment workflow

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
