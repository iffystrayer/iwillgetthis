## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- [ ] **Production Environment Variables:**
  ```bash
  # Database
  DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@host:port/aegis_production
  
  # Security
  SECRET_KEY=<strong-production-secret>
  JWT_SECRET_KEY=<strong-jwt-secret>
  
  # CORS
  CORS_ORIGINS=["https://aegis.yourdomain.com"]
  
  # AI Providers (if needed)
  OPENAI_API_KEY=<production-key>
  # ... other provider keys
  
  # External Services
  SMTP_SERVER=<production-smtp>
  EMAIL_FROM=<production-email>
  ```

### Database Migration
- [ ] Export development data
- [ ] Set up production MySQL database
- [ ] Run Alembic migrations
- [ ] Verify data integrity
- [ ] Set up automated backups

### Container Deployment
- [ ] Production Docker images built
- [ ] Container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker Swarm)
- [ ] Service discovery configuration
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Health checks configured

---

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Production Testing
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests completed
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Load testing performed
- [ ] User acceptance testing (UAT)

### Production Validation
- [ ] Smoke tests after deployment
- [ ] Critical user journeys tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks verified
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested

---

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (Day 1)
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance
- [ ] Verify all critical functionality
- [ ] Check log aggregation
- [ ] Validate backup procedures
- [ ] Update documentation

### Short-term (Week 1)
- [ ] Performance optimization based on real usage
- [ ] User feedback collection and analysis
- [ ] Security audit completion
- [ ] Training for operations team
- [ ] Incident response procedures tested

### Long-term (Month 1)
- [ ] Capacity planning review
- [ ] Cost optimization analysis
- [ ] Feature usage analytics
- [ ] User adoption metrics
- [ ] Technical debt assessment

---

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption or loss
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Authentication system failure
- More than 25% error rate

### Rollback Procedure
1. **Immediate**: Switch traffic to previous version
2. **Database**: Restore from last known good backup
3. **Containers**: Redeploy previous image versions
4. **DNS**: Update DNS records if needed
5. **Monitoring**: Verify rollback success

## Notes

### Known Issues
1. **Authentication Problem**: SQLAlchemy User model has relationship configuration issues
2. **Analytics Engine**: Temporarily disabled due to complexity
3. **AI Integration**: Some features require API keys to be fully functional

### Next Steps
1. Fix User model relationships to enable authentication
2. Complete security configuration
3. Set up production database
4. Configure monitoring and alerting
5. Perform comprehensive testing
