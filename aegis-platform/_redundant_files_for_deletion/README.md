# Redundant Files - Marked for Deletion

This folder contains files and directories that are redundant or no longer needed in the Aegis Platform project. These files are marked for deletion but preserved temporarily for safety.

## Contents

- **Backup files**: Old database backups and configuration files
- **Temporary files**: Build artifacts, cache files, and temporary directories
- **Duplicate files**: Redundant copies of configuration or documentation
- **Development artifacts**: Test files, debug logs, and development-only scripts

## Deletion Schedule

These files can be safely deleted after:
1. Confirming the platform is working correctly in production
2. All critical functionality has been tested
3. No references to these files exist in the active codebase
