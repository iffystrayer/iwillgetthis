## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Database Schema Problem
The main blocker is a **SQLAlchemy relationship error** in the backend:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.AmbiguousForeignKeysError: Could not determine join condition between parent/child tables on relationship User.user_roles - there are multiple foreign key paths linking the tables.
```

**Impact**: This prevents the authentication system from working properly, causing a cascade of failures.

### Secondary Issues Identified
1. **API Endpoint Structure**: All endpoints use `/api/v1/` prefix (correctly identified and fixed in tests)
2. **Authentication Flow**: Login endpoint expects JSON payload (correctly identified and fixed in tests)
3. **Database Initialization**: ✅ Database is properly initialized with 32 tables and sample users

## 🚨 Critical Issues & Recommendations

### 🔥 CRITICAL - Fix Database Schema (Priority 1)
**Issue**: SQLAlchemy relationship error preventing authentication

**Recommendation**: 
```python
# Fix the User.user_roles relationship in the User model
# Add explicit foreign_keys parameter to resolve ambiguity
user_roles = relationship("UserRole", back_populates="user", foreign_keys="UserRole.user_id")
```

**Impact**: This single fix will unlock all other functionality.

### ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY - Authentication System (Priority 2)
**Issue**: Once schema is fixed, verify authentication flow

**Recommendations**:
1. Test login with default credentials
2. Verify JWT token generation and validation
3. Test role-based access control
4. Validate session management

### 📋 MEDIUM PRIORITY - API Integration (Priority 3)
**Issue**: All protected endpoints return 403 due to auth failure

**Recommendations**:
1. Implement proper error handling for auth failures
2. Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
3. Enhance API documentation with auth examples
4. Add health checks for database connectivity

### 🔧 LOW PRIORITY - Enhancements (Priority 4)
**Recommendations**:
1. Add integration tests to CI/CD pipeline
2. Implement API versioning strategy
3. Add comprehensive logging for debugging
4. Create automated database migration scripts
