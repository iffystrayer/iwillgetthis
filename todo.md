    - Framework Integration (NIST CSF, CIS Controls pre-loaded)
    - Assessment Engine (control status tracking, risk creation logic)
    - Risk Register (configurable Likelihood/Impact matrix)
    - Basic Dashboard (key metrics and counts)

[ ] STEP 3: Advanced Features & Integrations → Web Development STEP (task_type="interactive")
    - Task Management (Kanban-style board, POA&M generation)
    - Evidence Management (file upload, rich-text editor)
    - External Integrations (OpenVAS, OpenCTI APIs)
    - Role-based Access Control (Admin, Analyst, ReadOnly)
    - Audit Trail system

[ ] STEP 4: AI-Powered Intelligence Layer → Web Development STEP (task_type="interactive")
