{"origin_pdf_path": "/workspace/user_input_files/Aegis Platform Implementation Plan.pdf", "text_in_pdf": "Aegis Platform Implementation Plan  \n\nThis plan is divided into four distinct phases, allowing for iterative development, testing, and feedback.  \n\n路 Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MvP) - Build the core, end-to-end risk management loop. 路 Phase 2: Core Enhancements & Integrations - Add key integrations and improve the user experience. 路 Phase 3: Intelligence Layer - Weave in the LLM-powered automation features. 路 Phase 4: Enterprise Readiness - Add features for scale, auditing, and advanced reporting  \n\nPhase 1: MVP - The Core Risk Management Loop  \n\nThe goal of this phase is to have a functional, end-to-end platform that allows a user to perform a basic risk assessment and track it to completion.  \n\nEpic 1: Foundation & Project Setup  \n\nTask: Initialize Git repository and establish branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow). Task: Set up cloud infrastructure (e.g., Azure App Service, Vercel, AWS Amplify)) Task: Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment Task: Set up project boilerplate for Frontend (Next.js) and Backend (FastAPI/Node.js) Task: Create initial database schema in PostgreSQL. Task: Implement basic design system tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) in the frontend.  \n\nEpic 2: User Authentication & Roles (Core)  \n\n  \n\nTask: Integrate Microsoft Entra ID using OAuth 2.0 for user login/logout.   \nTask: Create database tables for Users and basic Roles (Admin, Analyst, ReadOnly) Task: Implement backend middleware to protect authenticated routes.   \nTask: Build the frontend login page and logic for handling authentication tokens.   \nTask: Create a simple user profile page.  \n\nEpic 3: Asset Management (Core)  \n\nTask: Design and implement the Assets table in the database.   \nTask: Build backend API endpoints (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete) for assets Task: Create frontend Ul to list, add, edit, and view assets.   \nTask: Implement a basic CsV import function for assets.  \n\nEpic 4: Assessment & Analysis (Core)  \n\n  \n\nTask: Create a database seeding script to load NIST CSF and CIS Controls frameworks. Task: Build Ul to start a new assessment by selecting assets and a framework. Task: Develop the main assessment interface where users can set a status for each control (Implemented, Not Implemented, etc.).  \n\n$\\sqsupset$ Task: Implement the logic to automatically create a \"Risk\" in the Risk Register when a control is marked \"Not Implemented.\"   \n$\\sqsupset$ Task: Build the basic Risk Register Ul to view a list of identified risks.   \n$\\sqsupset$ Task: Implement the configurable Likelihood/Impact matrix and allow users to score risks.  \n\nEpic 5: Mitigation & Reporting (Core)  \n\nTask: From the Risk Register, allow users to create a simple remediation task (Title, Assignee, Status). Task: Build a basic Kanban or list view to track mitigation task status. Task: Create a single, simple report template (e.g., PDF export of the Risk Register)  \n\nEpic 6: Basic Dashboard  \n\n  \n\nTask: Design a simple, single dashboard for all users.   \nTask: Add widgets for basic counts: Total Assets, Open Risks, Assessments in Progress.  \n\nPhase 2: Core Enhancements & Integrations  \n\nWith the core loop functional, this phase focuses on adding the powerful integrations and improving the UX.  \n\nEpic 7: Advanced UX/UI Polish  \n\nTask: Implement the gradient accent colors and other visual design elements.   \nTask: Add smooth page transitions and micro-animations on interactive elements.   \nTask: Implement skeleton loaders for a better data-loading experience.   \nTask: Implement both Light and Dark modes.  \n\n  \n\nEpic 8: Evidence & Documentation  \n\nTask: Implement secure file upload capability for evidence (link to controls and tasks) Task: Add rich-text editor for control narratives and comments. Task: Build the \"Awaiting Review\" workflow gate for mitigation tasks.  \n\nEpic 9: OpenVAS Integration  \n\nTask: Develop a backend service to connect to the OpenVAS APl   \nTask: Create a UI for admins to configure the OpenVAS connection details securely.   \nTask: Implement the logic to correlate OpenVAS vulnerabilities with Aegis assets.   \nTask: Create a workflow to automatically flag controls (Cis 7) or create risks based on high-severity findings.  \n\nEpic 10: OpenCTI Integration  \n\nTask: Develop a backend service to connect to the OpenCTI GraphQL APl.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nTask: On the Risk Register page, create a new Ul tab or section called \"Threat Intel.\" Task: When a risk is viewed, query OpenCTI for related threat actors, malware, or campaigns and display the results.  \n\nEpic 11: Role-Based Dashboards  \n\n$\\sqsupset$ Task: Refactor the basic dashboard into a dynamic, widget-based system.   \n$\\sqsupset$ Task: Design and implement the CISO Cockpit, Analyst Workbench, and System Owner Inbox views.  \n\nPhase 3: Intelligence Layer (LLM Features)  \n\nThis phase introduces the Al capabilities that differentiate the platform.  \n\nEpic 12: LLM Service Integration  \n\nTask: Select an LLM provider (e.g., Azure OpenAl) and set up secure API access.   \nTask: Create a centralized backend service for managing prompts and parsing LLM responses.  \n\nEpic 13: Al-Powered Features  \n\nTask: (Evidence Analysis): Add a button to \"Analyze Evidence.\" Wire it to the LLM service to scan uploaded documents and provide a summary.   \nTask: (Narrative Generation): Add a \"Suggest Narrative\" button that uses evidence summaries to generate a draft narrative for a control.   \nTask: (Risk Statement Generation): Add a \"Generate with AI\" button on the Risk Register that uses technical data and threat intel to draft a formal risk statement.   \nTask: (Remediation Suggestions): Add a \"Suggest Plan\" button on mitigation tasks to generate a highlevel, step-by-step remediation plan.   \nTask: (Executive Summary): In the reporting module, add a \"Generate Executive Summary\" button that analyzes dashboard metrics to produce a narrative for leadership.  \n\nPhase 4: Enterprise Readiness  \n\nThis final phase adds features required for large-scale adoption, security, and compliance.  \n\nEpic 14: Advanced Reporting & Auditing  \n\n  \n\nTask: Develop the custom report builder with a drag-and-drop interface.   \nTask: Implement report scheduling and email distribution.   \nTask: Create a comprehensive audit trail for every significant action in the platform.   \nTask: Build a Ul to view and search the audit logs.  \n\nEpic 15: Advanced RBAC  \n\nTask: Extend the roles system to allow for custom, user-defined roles.   \nTask: Implement fine-grained permissions (e.g., restricting access to assets or modules based on role).  \n\n  \n\nEpic 16: Documentation  \n\n  \n\nTask: Set up the Astro project for documentation.   \nTask: Write comprehensive user guides for all major features and personas.   \nTask: Create admin guides for setting up integrations and authentication.  \n\n  \n\nEpic 17: Scalability & Security Hardening  \n\n  \n\nTask: Conduct performance and load testing on the platform.  \n\nTask: Perform a third-party penetration test and remediate findings.  \n\nTask: Optimize database queries and add caching where appropriate.", "files_in_pdf": [{"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/42dwzu.jpg", "size": 1064}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/uyi005.jpg", "size": 2887}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/7svcll.jpg", "size": 1064}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/accrnc.jpg", "size": 1026}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/iq1hxg.jpg", "size": 970}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/cfx3nd.jpg", "size": 2444}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/tl991k.jpg", "size": 1016}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/b86zu0.jpg", "size": 1041}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/im2cty.jpg", "size": 2179}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/zccxwi.jpg", "size": 976}, {"path": "extract/Aegis_Platform_Implementation_Plan_1751998304/images/fkkpd4.jpg", "size": 1064}]}
