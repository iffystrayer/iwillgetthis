# Aegis Platform Implementation Plan  

This plan is divided into four distinct phases, allowing for iterative development, testing, and feedback.  

路 Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MvP) - Build the core, end-to-end risk management loop. 路 Phase 2: Core Enhancements & Integrations - Add key integrations and improve the user experience. 路 Phase 3: Intelligence Layer - Weave in the LLM-powered automation features. 路 Phase 4: Enterprise Readiness - Add features for scale, auditing, and advanced reporting  

# Phase 1: MVP - The Core Risk Management Loop  

The goal of this phase is to have a functional, end-to-end platform that allows a user to perform a basic risk assessment and track it to completion.  

Epic 1: Foundation & Project Setup  

Task: Initialize Git repository and establish branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow). Task: Set up cloud infrastructure (e.g., Azure App Service, Vercel, AWS Amplify)) Task: Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment Task: Set up project boilerplate for Frontend (Next.js) and Backend (FastAPI/Node.js) Task: Create initial database schema in PostgreSQL. Task: Implement basic design system tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) in the frontend.  

Epic 2: User Authentication & Roles (Core)  

![](images/uyi005.jpg)  

Task: Integrate Microsoft Entra ID using OAuth 2.0 for user login/logout.   
Task: Create database tables for Users and basic Roles (Admin, Analyst, ReadOnly) Task: Implement backend middleware to protect authenticated routes.   
Task: Build the frontend login page and logic for handling authentication tokens.   
Task: Create a simple user profile page.  

Epic 3: Asset Management (Core)  

Task: Design and implement the Assets table in the database.   
Task: Build backend API endpoints (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete) for assets Task: Create frontend Ul to list, add, edit, and view assets.   
Task: Implement a basic CsV import function for assets.  

Epic 4: Assessment & Analysis (Core)  

![](images/im2cty.jpg)  

Task: Create a database seeding script to load NIST CSF and CIS Controls frameworks. Task: Build Ul to start a new assessment by selecting assets and a framework. Task: Develop the main assessment interface where users can set a status for each control (Implemented, Not Implemented, etc.).  

$\sqsupset$ Task: Implement the logic to automatically create a "Risk" in the Risk Register when a control is marked "Not Implemented."   
$\sqsupset$ Task: Build the basic Risk Register Ul to view a list of identified risks.   
$\sqsupset$ Task: Implement the configurable Likelihood/Impact matrix and allow users to score risks.  

Epic 5: Mitigation & Reporting (Core)  

Task: From the Risk Register, allow users to create a simple remediation task (Title, Assignee, Status). Task: Build a basic Kanban or list view to track mitigation task status. Task: Create a single, simple report template (e.g., PDF export of the Risk Register)  

Epic 6: Basic Dashboard  

![](images/b86zu0.jpg)  

Task: Design a simple, single dashboard for all users.   
Task: Add widgets for basic counts: Total Assets, Open Risks, Assessments in Progress.  

# Phase 2: Core Enhancements & Integrations  

With the core loop functional, this phase focuses on adding the powerful integrations and improving the UX.  

Epic 7: Advanced UX/UI Polish  

Task: Implement the gradient accent colors and other visual design elements.   
Task: Add smooth page transitions and micro-animations on interactive elements.   
Task: Implement skeleton loaders for a better data-loading experience.   
Task: Implement both Light and Dark modes.

# Epic 8: Evidence & Documentation  

Task: Implement secure file upload capability for evidence (link to controls and tasks) Task: Add rich-text editor for control narratives and comments. Task: Build the "Awaiting Review" workflow gate for mitigation tasks.  

Epic 9: OpenVAS Integration  

Task: Develop a backend service to connect to the OpenVAS APl   
Task: Create a UI for admins to configure the OpenVAS connection details securely.   
Task: Implement the logic to correlate OpenVAS vulnerabilities with Aegis assets.   
Task: Create a workflow to automatically flag controls (Cis 7) or create risks based on high-severity findings.  

Epic 10: OpenCTI Integration  

Task: Develop a backend service to connect to the OpenCTI GraphQL APl.  

![](images/42dwzu.jpg)  

![](images/tl991k.jpg)  

Task: On the Risk Register page, create a new Ul tab or section called "Threat Intel." Task: When a risk is viewed, query OpenCTI for related threat actors, malware, or campaigns and display the results.  

Epic 11: Role-Based Dashboards  

$\sqsupset$ Task: Refactor the basic dashboard into a dynamic, widget-based system.   
$\sqsupset$ Task: Design and implement the CISO Cockpit, Analyst Workbench, and System Owner Inbox views.  

# Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (LLM Features)  

This phase introduces the Al capabilities that differentiate the platform.  

Epic 12: LLM Service Integration  

Task: Select an LLM provider (e.g., Azure OpenAl) and set up secure API access.   
Task: Create a centralized backend service for managing prompts and parsing LLM responses.  

Epic 13: Al-Powered Features  

Task: (Evidence Analysis): Add a button to "Analyze Evidence." Wire it to the LLM service to scan uploaded documents and provide a summary.   
Task: (Narrative Generation): Add a "Suggest Narrative" button that uses evidence summaries to generate a draft narrative for a control.   
Task: (Risk Statement Generation): Add a "Generate with AI" button on the Risk Register that uses technical data and threat intel to draft a formal risk statement.   
Task: (Remediation Suggestions): Add a "Suggest Plan" button on mitigation tasks to generate a highlevel, step-by-step remediation plan.   
Task: (Executive Summary): In the reporting module, add a "Generate Executive Summary" button that analyzes dashboard metrics to produce a narrative for leadership.  

# Phase 4: Enterprise Readiness  

This final phase adds features required for large-scale adoption, security, and compliance.  

Epic 14: Advanced Reporting & Auditing  

![](images/cfx3nd.jpg)
